# R skills
To demonstrate my skills in R so far, I have uploaded a project regarding the effect of temperature on genes in C. elegans. 
The data had been used from the following article: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189445
Several methods will be used to answer research questions, namely;
1) Standard statistical values
2) Plotting barplots, heat maps, scatterplots. volcano plot
3) interpreting statistical results with biological processes
